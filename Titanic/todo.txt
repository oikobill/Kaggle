TO DO list:

1) Age prediction -- high priority
	* Usefull observation: most missing entries should be from the 3rd class (most probably)
	* Try: a) Predicting the median of 3rd class for age
		   b) Predicting the median of the particular class of the person
		   c) Make a model that predicts age and compare it to the take-the-median approach
		   
2) Titles -- medium priority
	* Try to come up with a set of more distinctive titles
	* Make a separate title called "child" for children (might be misleading to give children titles)

	* Explore survival by age based on the class to make the charisma feature

4) Charisma feature (multiply age by some manipulated form of age)

5) Families <-- HARD TASK -- low priority
	* Try to determine the families and see who survived

6) Try feature selection and see if it helps â€” medium priority
