TITANIC COMPETITION
--------------------


*Summary:* Given a training set containing information about around 900 of the passengers of the Titanic, I was asked to predict who survived and who didn't for a test set of 418 people.


*Competition url:* <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>


*Results:* My best entry gave a score of 82.297% on the leaderboard which landed me on the top 100 for the competition.


*Techniques:* I did a lot of feature engineering and experimented with a lot of classifiers such a Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, K Nearest Neighbors, SVM etc. I also tried making some ensemble classifiers which ended up giving me the best performance using skicit-learn. For an in-depth presentation of my findings and submissions take a look at `Preliminary Exploration.ipynb`


*Note:* My submission might not appear on the leaderboard after a while since Kaggle has adopted a policy for practice competitions under which entries from more than 2 months ago are removed from the leaderboard.
